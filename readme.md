WHAT: The goal of this project was to develop a Tic Tac Toe game, first playable in the console and then through the browser using the DOM.

WHY: The purpose was to gain experience with factory functions and the module pattern as a way to organize code effectively.

HOW: I first created a working console version of the game. I implemented a GameBoard object with an array representing the board, and a Player object to store player information. I wrote logic to track turns and check all eight possible win conditions. Once the console version was functional, I developed a graphical interface by creating buttons for each board square, detecting clicks, and displaying player moves in the browser.

TOOLS USED: Laptop, Oracle VirtualBox, Linux (Xubuntu), Visual Studio Code
